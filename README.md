# hello-world
this repository follows the tutorial on github.

Hi there,
My name is Semih Ozlem. I am a mathematics PhD student working in algebraic number theory. 

For an operating system, I use linux in particular ubuntu. I also sometimes use windows 10. Mainly because these are the operating systems I have been able to get to work on my computer, and be able to write mathematics.

I am working on short python programs that mainly work in linux system to make certain tasks that require string searches. These are applicable in a variety of cases. I am still testing the code and trying to make it usable in various contexts.

I will write more details later.
